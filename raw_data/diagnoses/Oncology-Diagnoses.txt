## Acute Myeloid Leukaemia
__Occurrence: Uncommon | Base Payment: $3200__
Acute Myeloid Leukaemia develops when the body makes too many immature white blood cells known as myeloid blast cells, also called myeloblasts. The myeloblasts multiply out of control and continue to divide but never mature into normal cells.  The abnormal blast cells are known as leukaemia cells. Because the leukaemia cells are immature and abnormal, they don’t carry out the usual infection-fighting function of white blood cells. They also crowd out normal white blood cells, which then can’t work properly. This increases the risk of infections.

## ALL (B Cell)
__Occurrence: Ultra Rare | Base Payment: $5125__
B-cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia, also known as Burkitt-type acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) or Mature B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a cancer that affects your "B lymphocytes" -- white blood cells that grow in the soft center of your bones, called marrow. This type of ALL is less common accounting for around 3-5% of all adult cases. The hallmark of mature B-cell ALL is the presence of surface immunoglobulin on the lymphoblasts. Using conventional regimens, only 30-40% of patients enter complete remission (CR) and few patients survive long term.

## ALL (Pre-B Cell)
__Occurrence: Very Rare | Base Payment: $3200__
Pre-B Cell Acute lymphocytic Leukaemia (ALL) (Also known as Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. ALL is characterised by an overproduction of immature white blood cells, called lymphoblasts or leukaemic blasts. Because the bone marrow is unable to make adequate numbers of red cells, normal white cells and platelets, people with ALL become more susceptible to anaemia, recurrent infections, and to bruising and bleeding easily. In between 75-80% of adult cases, ALL arises in B-lymphocytes in the early stages of development in the bone marrow. The disease is therefore called precursor B-cell ALL or Pre-B-cell ALL.

## Basal Cell Carcinoma (Stage 4)
__Occurrence: Ultra Rare | Base Payment: $3200__
Basal cell cancer is the most common form of cancer in humans. It is a type of non-melanoma skin cancer that starts in the basal cell layer of the epidermis (the top layer of skin), grows very slowly, and rarely spreads (metastasizes).\n\nIn Stage 4, the cancer has spread to areas outside the skin, such as to distant organs like the brain or lungs, or has invaded the skeleton.

## CLL (Advanced)
__Occurrence: Very Rare | Base Payment: $3200__
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL)(Advanced)(Rare) is a type of slow-growing leukaemia that affects developing B-lymphocytes. B lymphocytes (also known as B-cells) are specialised white blood cells. Under normal conditions they produce immunoglobulins (also called antibodies) that help protect our bodies against infection and disease. In people with CLL, lymphocytes undergo a malignant (cancerous) change and become leukaemic cells. It is important to emphasise that for many people CLL remains stable for many months and years and has little, if any, impact on their lifestyle or general health. Around 30-50% of people diagnosed with CLL never require any treatment for their disease and can survive for many years despite their diagnosis. Because CLL develops slowly many people don’t have any symptoms, particularly in the early stages, and the disease is picked up during a routine blood test.

## CML (Accelerated  Phase)
__Occurrence: Unique | Base Payment: $920__
Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML)(Accelerated  Phase) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. In CML the bone marrow produces too many white cells, called granulocytes. These cells (sometimes called blasts or leukaemic blasts) gradually crowd the bone marrow, interfering with normal blood cell production. They also spill out of the bone marrow and circulate around the body in the bloodstream. Because they are not fully mature, they are unable to work properly to fight infections. Over time, a shortage of red cells and platelets can cause anaemia, bleeding and/or bruising. Overall, CML is a rare disease, accounting for around 0.03% of all cancers diagnosed. Many people with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) have no symptoms. Accelerated – In the accelerated phase, the number of immature blast cells has risen, and sometimes new chromosomal changes, in addition to the Ph chromosome, will occur.

## Ductal Carcinoma In Situ
__Occurrence: Unique | Base Payment: $1250__
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is non-invasive breast cancer.  Ductal means that the cancer starts inside the milk ducts, carcinoma refers to any cancer that begins in the skin or other tissues (including breast tissue) that cover or line the internal organs, and in situ means "in its original place." DCIS is called "non-invasive" because it hasn’t spread beyond the milk duct into any normal surrounding breast tissue. DCIS isn’t life-threatening, but having DCIS can increase the risk of developing an invasive breast cancer later on. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) means that there are too many cells and they have the features of cancer, but they are still confined to the inside of the duct. Although it is rare, men can develop breast cancer. \n\nDCIS generally has no signs or symptoms.

## Follicular Lymphoma
__Occurrence: Uncommon | Base Payment: $160__
Follicular lymphoma is the most common sub-type of indolent (slow-growing) NHL (Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma), comprising 20% to 30% of all NHL. Follicular lymphoma typically affects middle-aged or older adult. Like most indolent lymphomas, people diagnosed with follicular lymphoma usually have lymphoma in many parts of the body at the time of diagnosis. A small percentage of people with FL can have their lymphoma transform into a more aggressive form of NHL, usually a DLBC over time. If diagnosed at an early stage there may be no treatment given (Watch and Wait).

## Hairy Cell Leukaemia Variant
__Occurrence: Unique | Base Payment: $3200__
Hairy Cell Leukemia variant (HCL-V) is defined as a rare and indolent form of small, mature, B-cell leukemia characterized by splenomegaly, an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and hyper-cellular bone marrow. HCL-V is more aggressive and resistant to therapy than classical HCL. HCL variant was previously thought to be a subtype of HCL, but in 2008, the World Health Organization concluded that it was a separate entity from HCL and biologically distinct. HCL variant is rarer than HCL and has a different clinical course.

## Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)
__Occurrence: Common | Base Payment: $1700__
Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), sometimes called infiltrating ductal carcinoma, is the most common type of breast cancer. About 80% of all breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas. Invasive means that the cancer has “invaded” or spread to the surrounding breast tissues. Ductal means that the cancer began in the milk ducts, which are the “pipes” that carry milk from the milk-producing lobules to the nipple. Carcinoma refers to any cancer that begins in the skin or other tissues that cover internal organs — such as breast tissue. All together, “invasive ductal carcinoma” refers to cancer that has broken through the wall of the milk duct and begun to invade the tissues of the breast. Over time, invasive ductal carcinoma can spread to the lymph nodes and possibly to other areas of the body. Although it is rare, men can develop breast cancer. \n\nAt first, invasive ductal carcinoma may not cause any symptoms.

## Large Cell Lung Carcinoma
__Occurrence: Very Rare | Base Payment: $1363__
Large cell carcinoma of the lungs is a form of non-small cell lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancers account for 80 percent of lung cancers, and of these, roughly 10 percent are large cell carcinoma of the lung. ﻿Unlike some lung cancers that more commonly present with a cough or lung infections, early symptoms often include a vague sense of shortness of breath and fatigue. Large cell carcinomas are also called large cell lung cancers. They are named for the appearance of large round cells when examined under the microscope, although the tumours themselves tend to be large as well when diagnosed. Large cell carcinomas often occur in the outer regions of the lungs, and tend to grow rapidly and spread more quickly than some other forms of non-small cell lung cancer.

## Lung Adenocarcinoma (Advanced)
__Occurrence: Common | Base Payment: $1650__
Adenocarcinoma of the lung is the most common type of lung cancer, and like other forms of lung cancer, it is characterized by distinct cellular and molecular features. It is classified as one of several non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), to distinguish it from small cell lung cancer which has a different behavior and prognosis. Lung cancer typically doesn't cause signs and symptoms in its earliest stages. Signs and symptoms of lung cancer typically occur only when the disease is advanced. \n\nWith advanced cancer, tumours can be of any size and have very likely spread to lymph nodes on the other side of the chest, near the collarbone, or have invaded other structures in the chest such as the heart or esophagus.

## Mantle Cell Lymphoma
__Occurrence: Ultra Rare | Base Payment: $3900__
Mantle cell lymphoma is a relatively uncommon type of lymphoma, accounting for approximately 5% to 10% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas. It affects the outer edge (mantle zone) of B-cells in the lymph node follicle. In 85% of cases, an abnormality occurs when two chromosomes (11 and 14) break and join together with each other. This is called a ‘translocation’ and causes B-cells to over-produce a protein called cyclin D1. In usual quantities, Cyclin D1 helps to promote normal cell growth, with excess amounts resulting in uncontrolled growth of mantle zone cells which can lead to MCL.

## Merkel Cell Carcinoma (Local)
__Occurrence: Ultra Rare | Base Payment: $1250__
Merkel cell carcinoma (Rare) is a rare type of skin cancer that usually appears as a flesh-coloured or bluish-red nodule, often on your face, head or neck. Merkel cell carcinoma is also called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. Merkel cell carcinoma tends to grow quickly and to metastasize (spread) at an early stage. It usually spreads first to nearby lymph nodes and then may spread to lymph nodes or skin in distant parts of the body, lungs, brain, bones, or other organs. Merkel cell carcinoma is the second most common cause of skin cancer death after melanoma.

## Metastatic Breast Cancer
__Occurrence: Very Rare | Base Payment: $3200__
Metastatic breast cancer (also called stage IV) is breast cancer that has spread to another part of the body, most commonly the liver, brain, bones, or lungs. Cancer cells can break away from the original tumour in the breast and travel to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or the lymphatic system, which is a large network of nodes and vessels that works to remove bacteria, viruses, and cellular waste products. Breast cancer can come back in another part of the body months or years after the original diagnosis and treatment. Nearly 30% of women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer will develop metastatic disease. Although it is rare, men can develop breast cancer.

## Metastatic Liver Cancer
__Occurrence: Very Rare | Base Payment: $3200__
A liver metastasis is a cancerous tumour that has spread to the liver from a cancer that started in another place in the body. It's also called secondary liver cancer. Primary liver cancer originates in the liver and most commonly affects individuals who have risk factors such as hepatitis or cirrhosis. When metastastic, it means that cancer has invaded other parts of the body, such as other organs, nearby lymph nodes or bone.

## Metastatic Lung Cancer
__Occurrence: Ultra Rare | Base Payment: $3200__
Lung cancer begins when abnormal cells grow and multiply in an uncontrolled way in one or both of the lungs. It can spread to other parts of the body such as the lymph nodes, brain, adrenal glands, liver and bones. When a tumour grows and becomes more aggressive, it requires more space and begins to spread to other areas. This stage is the start of metastatic lung cancer.

## Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma (High Grade)
__Occurrence: Ultra Rare | Base Payment: $3200__
Mucoepidermoid carcinomas are the most common type of salivary gland cancer. Most start in the parotid glands. They develop less often in the submandibular glands or in minor salivary glands inside the mouth. Approximately 80% of patients with facial nerve paralysis have nodal metastasis at the time of diagnosis. These patients have a much lower average survival rate compared to low grade tumours. The major determinants of survival are histology and clinical stage. Poor prognostic factors include high grade, neural involvement, locally advanced disease, advanced age, associated pain, regional lymph node metastases, distant metastasis, and accumulation of p53 or c-erbB2 oncoproteins.  Mucoepidermoid carcinoma can also be found in other organs, such as bronchi, lacrimal sac, and thyroid gland.

## NK-Cell LGL Leukaemia
__Occurrence: Ultra Rare | Base Payment: $850__
NK-Cell large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukaemia is a type of chronic leukaemia affecting white blood cells called "lymphocytes." Lymphocytes are part of the body's immune system and help fight certain infections. LGL leukemia is characterized by enlarged lymphocytes, containing noticeable granules, which can be seen when the blood is examined under the microscope. There are two types of LGL leukemia: T-cell (T-LGL) and natural killer cell (NK-LGL). The frequency of T-cell and NK-cell LGL leukaemia ranges from 2 to 5 percent. The majority of patients with NK-cell leukaemia are asymptomatic, but patients with an aggressive variant usually have hepatomegaly and splenomegaly and often have B symptoms. About a third have lymphadenopathy and extranodal involvement may also occur. On average, patients are younger than those with T-cell LGL leukaemia.

## Pheochromocytoma (Metastatic)
__Occurrence: Unique | Base Payment: $3200__
Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumour of adrenal gland tissue. It results in the release of too much epinephrine and norepinephrine, hormones that control heart rate, metabolism, and blood pressure. Metastatic, the cancer has spread from where the tumour began to a distant part of the body. To predict the likelihood of metastatic spread, several criteria and scoring systems have been developed on the basis of histopathology or clinical data, but no system has proven reliable.

## Prostate Cancer (Stage 1)
__Occurrence: Uncommon | Base Payment: $160__
Prostate cancer is cancer that occurs in the prostate, a small walnut-shaped gland in men that produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm. Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men. Usually prostate cancer grows slowly and is initially confined to the prostate gland, where it may not cause serious harm. However, while some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment, other types are aggressive and can spread quickly. \n\nIn Stage 1, the cancer is confined to the prostate. Stage 1 can’t be detected during a digital rectal exam. It is usually expected to be slow growing.

## SC Lung Cancer (Extensive Stage)
__Occurrence: Very Rare | Base Payment: $3200__
Small Cell Lung Cancer begins when healthy cells in the lung change and grow out of control, forming a mass called a tumour, a lesion, or a nodule. SCLC begins in the nerve cells or hormone-producing cells of the lung. The term “small cell” refers to the size and shape of the cancer cells as seen under a microscope. Extensive stage is used to describe SCLC that has spread to parts of the body such as the other lung, bone, brain, or bone marrow. Many doctors consider SCLC that has spread to the fluid around the lung to be extensive stage as well. About 2 out of 3 people with SCLC have extensive disease when the cancer is first found.

Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC)(Rare) is a rare form of highly malignant adenocarcinoma that produces mucin. It is an epithelial malignancy characterized by the histologic appearance of signet ring cells. Primary SRCC tumours are most often found in the glandular cells of the stomach (SRCC originates in the stomach in 90 percent of patients), and less frequently in the breast, gallbladder, urinary bladder, and pancreas. SRCCs do not normally form in the lungs. Among colorectal cancers, the prevalence of SRCC is less than one percent.

## T-Cell LGL Leukaemia
__Occurrence: Ultra Rare | Base Payment: $850__
T-Cell large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukaemia is a type of chronic leukaemia affecting white blood cells called "lymphocytes." Lymphocytes are part of the body's immune system and help fight certain infections. LGL leukemia is characterized by enlarged lymphocytes, containing noticeable granules, which can be seen when the blood is examined under the microscope. There are two types of LGL leukemia: T-cell (T-LGL) and natural killer cell (NK-LGL). The frequency of T-cell and NK-cell LGL leukaemia ranges from 2 to 5 percent. T-cell large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukaemia is a clonal proliferation of cytotoxic T cells, which causes neutropenia, anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia. This condition is often associated with autoimmune disorders, especially rheumatoid arthritis, and other lymphoproliferative disorders.

## T-Cell Prolymphocytic Leukaemia
__Occurrence: Unique | Base Payment: $4130__
T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) is an extremely rare and typically aggressive malignancy (cancer) that is characterized by the out of control growth of mature T-cells (T-lymphocytes). T-cells are a type of white blood cell that protects the body from infections. T-PLL affects older adults with a median age at diagnosis of 61 years, and it is more common in men than in women. Abnormal changes (mutations) in the genes of a T-cell can cause a normal, healthy T-cell to become a cancer cell. These genetic errors in the mutated T-cell tell the cell to keep growing and dividing when a healthy cell would typically stop dividing and eventually die. Every cell that arises from the initial leukemia cell also has the same mutated DNA. As a result, over time the number of leukaemia cells multiply and can travel in the blood to other sites including the bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes and sometimes skin.

## UD NSC Lung Cancer (Localised)
__Occurrence: Rare | Base Payment: $920__
Undifferentiated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) begins when healthy cells in the lung change and grow out of control, forming a mass called a tumour, a lesion, or a nodule. A lung tumour can begin anywhere in the lung. Undifferentiated is used to describe cells or tissues that do not have specialized ("mature") structures or functions. Undifferentiated cancer cells often grow and spread quickly. Localised, the cancer is found in the lung but has not progressed to the lymph nodes or distant organs.
