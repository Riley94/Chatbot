## Anaplastic Astrocytoma
__Occurrence: Ultra Rare | Base Payment: $4040__
Anaplastic astrocytoma is a rare malignant brain tumour. Astrocytomas are tumours that develop from certain star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes. Astrocytes and similar cells form tissue that surrounds and protects other nerve cells found within the brain and spinal cord.

## Diffuse Astrocytoma
__Occurrence: Ultra Rare | Base Payment: $4040__
Diffuse astrocytomas, also referred to as low-grade infiltrative astrocytomas, are designated as WHO II tumours of the brain. The term diffuse infiltrating means there is no identifiable border between the tumour and normal brain tissue, even though the borders may appear well-marginated on imaging.

## Pilocytic Astrocytoma
__Occurrence: Ultra Rare | Base Payment: $3620__
Grade I astrocytomas are also called pilocytic astrocytomas. These tumours occur in children and young adults. They are less invasive than other grades and have a relatively good prognosis.  They usually arise in the cerebellum, near the brainstem, in the hypothalamic region, or the optic chiasm, but they may occur in any area where astrocytes are present, including the cerebral hemispheres and the spinal cord. These tumours are usually slow growing and benign.
