## Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma: Stage III
__Occurrence: Very Rare | Base Payment: $4500__
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma, or ccRCC, is a type of kidney cancer. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is named after how the tumor looks under the microscope. The cells in the tumor look clear, like bubbles. Stage III means it can be a tumor of any size with involvement of a nearby lymph node but no metastases to distant organs. Tumour of this stage may be with or without spread to fatty tissue around the kidney, with or without spread into the large veins leading from the kidney to the heart. In this case the cancer has spread into lymph nodes around the kidney.

## Extraperitoneal Bladder Rupture
__Occurrence: Very Rare | Base Payment: $2000__
Extraperitoneal Bladder Rupture: If the tear is at the bottom or side of the bladder, the urine will leak into the tissues around the bladder instead of the abdominal cavity. Complex injuries of this type should be repaired with surgery. But often it can be treated by simply placing a wide catheter into the bladder to keep it empty. The urine and blood drain into a collection bag. It usually takes at least 10 days for the bladder to heal. The catheter is left in the bladder until an X-ray shows that the leak has sealed. If the catheter doesn’t drain properly, surgery is needed.

## Intraperitoneal Bladder Rupture
__Occurrence: Very Rare | Base Payment: $2000__
Intraperitoneal Bladder Rupture: If the tear is on the top of the bladder, the hole will usually open to the part of the abdomen that holds the liver, spleen, and bowel. Urine leaking into the abdomen is a serious problem. This tear can be sewn closed with surgery. A catheter is left in the bladder for up to 2 weeks after surgery to allow the bladder to rest. The tube will either come out through the urethra or out through the skin below the belly button.
