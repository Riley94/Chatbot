## Amputated Digit (GT)[R]
__Occurrence: Unlikely | Base Payment: $2100__
Traumatic amputation is the loss of a body part that occurs as the result of an accident or injury. In this case, a digit on the patient's hand has been amputated and requires immediate medical attention to attempt to restore function to the hand and digit. Sharp, guillotine-type (GT) injuries with relatively uninjured surrounding tissue have the best post-replantation prognosis, with a success rate of 77%. Severe crush injuries (CI), multi-level injuries, and avulsion injuries often mangle soft tissue to the point of precluding rejoining of essential blood vessels, making replantation impossible. In such cases, revision amputation of the stump may be necessary.

Hair transplantation is a surgical technique that removes hair follicles from one part of the body, called the 'donor site', to a bald or balding part of the body known as the 'recipient site'.

In this minimally invasive procedure, grafts containing hair follicles that are genetically resistant to balding (like the back of the head) are transplanted to the bald scalp. Hair transplantation can also be used to restore eyelashes, eyebrows, beard hair, chest hair, pubic hair and to fill in scars caused by accidents or surgery such as face-lifts and previous hair transplants.

## Hypertrophic Scar (Simple)[R]
